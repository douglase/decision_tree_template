decision_tree git repository.

Setup a graphviz (http://graphviz.org/) decision tree for a science team to visual 
the flow of decisions.

In Ubuntu linux flavors install graphviz with:
    
    sudo apt-get install graphviz

base.dot is the template, an possible implimentation
 is each countdown item has a .dot file, which is converted to a .tex page and which are all compiled together to form a 
handbook (last is yet to be implimented).


ideally uses the dot2tex python module, easily installed with:
    
    pip install dot2tex

Convert to tex:
$ dot2tex -ftikz -s base.dot >test.tex --docpreamble="\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}"

convert to pdf:
$ pdflatex \\nonstopmode\\input test.tex
